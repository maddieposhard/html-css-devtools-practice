        Hello, my name is Maddie.
    </h1>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby is sewing. My grandma taught me when I was a child. I used to stay with her while my mom worked during the summer months, and she spent a lot of time and patience helping me make clothes for all my dolls. I've moved on to sewing clothes for myself now, and my grandma is no longer living, but when I sit in front of the sewing machine she handed down to me, I still feel close to her.
